In 2017 I came to the USA for the first time to the State of Massachusetts, I saw something very weird to me: Most of the large and beautiful churches had the LGTB flag üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà. I went to a Lutheran church (ELCA), many of them firmly believe that LGTB lifestyle is totally compatible with the scriptures. I started attending an ECC church, after spending more than a year there the pastors told the congregation that the Bible is not clear on this issue so both positions would be accepted \[actually it means that the church will be pro-LGBT\]. That is why I wrote this article evaluating whether this position is biblical or not.¬†

Let's start at the base, the biblical text.

> And you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination
> 
> Leviticus 18:22

> If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them
> 
> Leviticus 20:13

> For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions; for their females exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the males abandoned the natural function of the female and burned in their desire toward one another, males with males committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error
> 
> Romans 1:26-27

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals
> 
> 1 Corinthians 6:9

> for sexually immoral persons, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching
> 
> 1 Timothy 1:10

A simple reading of the scripture and these passages gives us a clear conclusion: The scripture condemns homosexuality. But, then, How is it possible that these churches affirm that scripture views homosexuality or LGTB ideas positively?

Talking to a Lutheran pastor and reading the arguments of the Reformation Project<sup>[^a30576b9-daa8-4a2b-af29-b885d73ac042]</sup>, the main reason for holding this view is:

> In Paul's time, lasting monogamous homosexual love relationships did not exist, so what the scripture condemns is the type of homosexual relationship that only existed at that time: pedophilia and sexual abuse. Therefore, if Paul had known the faithful and loving homosexual couples of today, he would have accepted them.
> 
> Lutheran Pastor (ELCA)

There are two key points from this statement to review:

- Monogamous homosexual love relationships did not exist.

- Paul would accept it, ancient Christianity and so on.

## Same-sex relations in the times of the apostles

Thomas K. Hubbard tells us that usually when we read about this topic there is a basic assumption of sexual relations between men.

> "Men in Athens in the fifth century B.c. were not judged by whether they had sex with other men, only whether they were seen as the penetrator or the penetrate‚Äù. Indeed, this belief has approached the status of dogma in post-Foucauldian discourse on ancient sexuality. And like much dogma, it is wrong.
> 
> Popular Perceptions of Elite Homosexuality in Classical Athens ([‚Üí](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20163707){target=blank})

If we interpret historical facts with that assumption, we will reject all historical evidence of same-sex monogamous couples as anecdotal, dystopian or simply inaccurate. And we will only have a truncated vision of history, not useful to understand the biblical times.

There was, in fact, no more consensus about homosexuality in ancient Greece and Rome than there is today. In these heavily discourse-oriented cultures, as in our own, sexual dissidence was a Ô¨Çash point of ideological contention<sup>[^64142b5b-60ee-4132-ba1e-86a7ddcae78f]</sup>.

Laura P√©rez about Rome:

> Although Roman laws show a panorama of strict control of the practices considered most openly infamous, between the last years of the Republic and the first of the Empire the situation changed towards a greater flexibility of these limits, until almost complete oblivion of the _Lex Scantinia_ which, although it remained in force, apparently was not respected at all. An opening occurred and both the relationships with boys who were no slaves but citizens, as well as the existence of adults who assumed the passive role and publicly showed their effeminacy, became much more visible. The satires of Marcial and Juvenal constitute the most acidic testimony of this reality that was perceived to be increasingly widespread and less censored. To such a point that even the emperors themselves have been able to obtain a reputation as passive loved ones. This new situation could not fail to be noticed also in the most eastern provinces of the Empire and, consequently, could not be foreign to Philo, who in his speech directs his criticism precisely towards the evident tolerance and diffusion of the phenomenon in its contemporary social context.¬†

## Homosexual relations in ancient Greece

Let's start with the historical context and analyze whether monogamous homosexual love existed as a concept and/or practice at that time.

Plato wrote ‚ÄúSymposium" (385‚Äì370 BC) a book that addresses questions: what is love; relationships through love; what types of love are worthy of praise; the purpose of love, etc. Pausanias divides love into ordinary and heavenly, attributing the latter to exclusively homosexual male relationships.

> Those whom he \[heavenly love\] inspires love only the naturally stronger and more intelligent male sex‚Ä¶¬† They are not attracted by great youth, but by young people whose intelligence is beginning to develop‚Ä¶ It would be truly desirable if there were a law prohibiting loving young men who are too young‚Ä¶ Love, as I said before, is neither beautiful nor ugly in and of itself. It is beautiful if you love obeying the laws of honorability‚Ä¶ But the lover of a beautiful soul remains faithful throughout his life because he loves what is lasting
> 
> Symposium by Plato. (Pages 12-17 in Spanish [‚Üí](https://www.elejandria.com/libro/el-banquete/platon/1682){target=blank})

Aristophanes remarks:

> Women who come from the separation of primitive women do not pay much attention to men and are rather interested in women... Men from the separation of primitive men similarly seek the male sex... These men who spend their entire lives together... find so much sweetness in living like this... in such a way that you will cease to be two people to be nothing more than one and while you live you will live a common life, as one person, and when you die You will be united in such a way that you will not be two people, but also one
> 
> Symposium by Plato. (Pages 24-25 in Spanish [‚Üí](https://www.elejandria.com/libro/el-banquete/platon/1682){target=blank})

We clearly see that Plato describes long life monogamous homosexual love relationships (non-exploitative, non-coercive, same-status) as something totally acceptable. Someone may object: ‚ÄúIt is just a book, that did not happen in ancient Greece‚Äù, but it did happen there.

In Thebes, a city neighboring Corinthians (with whom they had a political-military alliance), ‚ÄúThe sacred band of Thebes<sup>[^aada2aa9-2c21-42ad-a9d0-c1407d5a3264]</sup>‚Äù was formed with 150 homosexual couples who loved each other, Plutarch explains:

> A band that is held together by the friendship between lovers is indissoluble and not to be broken, since the lovers are ashamed to play the coward before their beloved, and the beloved before their lovers, and both stand firm in danger to protect each other.
> 
> Plutarch, Pelopidas. (chapter 18 [‚Üí](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0007,021:18){target=blank})

In Athens, observers like Xenophon noted that male lovers among the Boeotians (the ethnic group that included the Thebans) lived together ‚Äúas yoke-mates‚Äù, a metaphor usually used of heterosexual marriage. Aristotle, in a work now lost but cited by Plutarch, described how Theban male couples swore vows of fidelity to one another beside the tombs of Heracles and Lolaus, a mythic pair of heroes assumed by most Greeks to have also been sexual partners<sup>[^b2308a11-a2a4-4e5f-94bb-bdcd2d3a92be]</sup>.

Therefore, monogamous homosexual couples did exist in the ancient world, and arguments promoting LGBTQ inclusion in churches based on that claim cannot hold up.

But, talking to a friend about it, he told me that the Levitical laws are not for christians, the book of Romans talks about excesses and both Corinthians and Timothy talks about abuse or pedophilia. What I understood from him is: Despite showing him those historical facts, he approaches the scripture with the statement ‚ÄúGod approves homosexuality‚Äù. Therefore, although the scripture says the opposite, it will look for a way that affirms its presupposition. It means that the basis of his faith is outside of Scripture and he reads it (what should be the basis of his faith) based on his cultural presuppositions and/or pressures.

## _Malakoi_ and _Arsenokoitai_

In order to not make this article so long. I will refer only to 1 Corinthians 6:9, because Corinthians is in Greece, very close to Thebes, culturally similar, Levitical law is being used by Paul and it also seems the letter was sent presumably to each congregation in Greece<sup>[^211a415c-0d34-4e99-95ba-bbf5c566b52f]</sup>.

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate (**_malakoi_**), nor homosexuals (**_arsenokoitai_**)
> 
> 1 Corinthians 6:9

The word malakoi means ‚Äúeffeminate‚Äù<sup>[^a67fd57d-274c-4b89-ab22-dd1c4acfe8ba]</sup>. The explanation from progressives churches is that this word means ‚Äúlack of self-control, weakness, cowardice, and laziness‚Äù (In any case, this causes problems for the scriptures, since Paul would be a patriarchal sexist, he uses the feminine being - a woman - as something bad).

But what does it mean? How do we know? When a Jew used _malakoi_, what did he mean? Did anyone use it in ancient times?¬†

Laura Per√©z<sup>[^b63c3ad4-587f-4cca-b4d8-f839b2309f41]</sup> note that _Malakoi_ is used by a famous Jew, Philo of Alexandria<sup>[^cf5faffd-3cae-4dd2-99f6-a5176810ef97]</sup>, in the context of men dressing like women to satisfy their lovers.

> Being accustomed to bearing the affliction of being treated like women, waste away as to both their souls and bodies, not bearing about them a single spark of a manly character to be kindled into a flame, but having even the hair of their heads conspicuously curled and adorned, and having their faces smeared with vermilion, and paint, and things of that kind, and having their eyes pencilled beneath, and having their skins anointed with fragrant perfumes (for in such persons as these a sweet smell is a most seductive quality), and being well appointed in everything that tends to beauty or elegance, are not ashamed to devote their constant study and endeavours to the task of changing their manly character into an effeminate one‚Ä¶ And some of these persons have even carried their admiration of these delicate pleasures of youth so far that they have desired wholly to change their condition for that of women, and have castrated themselves and have clothed themselves in purple robes.¬†
> 
> The Works of Philo - The special laws 3:37-42 ([‚Üí](https://www.elejandria.com/libro/el-banquete/platon/1682){target=blank})

In addition to the historical context by Philo, we can also read the Corinthians book context. Paul refers to something similar (without using the word _malakoi_) in 1 Corinthians 11 regarding the veil (a feminine element that gave status to women<sup>[^079ddbb0-11ed-4c1c-a074-f3fdd810f29c]</sup>) Paul says

> Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying, shames his head‚Ä¶ For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of man.
> 
> 1 Corinthians 11:4,7

Paul is applying

> A woman shall not wear man‚Äôs clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman‚Äôs clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God
> 
> Deuteronomy 22:5

God's law prohibits a person from dressing as the opposite sex, but even with that, progressive churches say that it is permissible to marry someone of the same sex. It doesn't follow because the most basic thing is already prohibited. It's like Jesus taught us about adultery of the heart, we follow the spirit of the law, not just the letter of it. But for someone committed with the LGTB agenda may bypass this law of God saying ‚Äúif Paul knew gender identity would accept our doctrine‚Äù, because for them the current cultural presuppositions are the base rule in order to interpret the scripture. But if we use any LGTB arguments to approve same-sex relationships, we can use exactly the same arguments to bypass any law of those leviticus chapters or any law of God in general, making the law of God meaningless.

Now, we will examine the word _arsenokoitai_. This word means ‚Äúa male engaging in same-gender sexual activity<sup>[^ac98ec8a-a507-4a22-a5e7-ea9c65261fbc]</sup>‚Äù. Arsenokoitƒìs was probably coined by Hellenistic Jews from a conflation of two Greek words appearing in the Septuagint's rendering of Lev 18:22 and 20:13: meta **arsen**os ou koimƒìthƒìsƒì **koit**ƒìn gynaikeian (18:22); hos an koimƒìthƒì meta **arsen**os **koit**ƒìn gynaikos (20:13). The Greek word for "male" is arsƒìn and the word for "bed" or "lying" is koitƒì<sup>[^3f3dd189-8463-4a16-881f-9c6cabc64fb8]</sup>.

This clearly concludes that Paul is quoting the Levitical law. Although this does not satisfy the proponents of progressive theology, it is clearly demonstrable if we see the context of chapters five and six of First Corinthians.

In chapter five Paul condemns the church for being proud of having a person who had a relationship with his stepmother. The question is, where did Paul get that the relationship is sinful? In the end, are they two adults who love each other? Paul knows this because he is applying

> You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father‚Äôs wife; it is your father‚Äôs nakedness.
> 
> Leviticus 18:8

> If there is a man who lies with his father‚Äôs wife, he has uncovered his father‚Äôs nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.
> 
> Leviticus 20:11

So, Paul applies the law of God in Leviticus 18 and 20 in 1 Corinthians 5. It would be strange to conclude that he does not apply the same law in 1 Corinthians 6:9 when he also uses the same words and the same chapters of Leviticus. Furthermore, Paul's use of the Leviticus chapters makes those laws (Lev 18:22; 20:13) binding on Christians now, even if we do not believe that _arsenokoitai_ is a quote from those laws.

In any case, if readers are not satisfied with all this evidence, they can read the understanding of _arsenokoitai_ by the first translators of the Bible (Latin, Syriac, Coptic)<sup>[^00bbe9f8-3cfd-49dc-b661-6b62fe106690]</sup> or its historical uses in the book "[The Bible and Homosexual Practice: Texts and Hermeneutics](https://www.amazon.com/Bible-Homosexual-Practice-Texts-Hermeneutics/dp/0687022797/){target=blank}" by Robert Gagnon.

## Conclusion

The scripture clearly shows that it is forbidden for a Christian to have homosexual relations and/or to dress and/or act like the opposite sex. Meanwhile, in the United States the progressive movement began a long time ago to try to justify the opposite. One of the first precursors of the progressive churches even said that Paul was a repressed homosexual and that was why he was homophobic and misogynist<sup>[^73ba2208-899f-4b6f-ad96-c0553ab0f59c]</sup>. They knew that same-sex relationships are prohibited in the scriptures and claimed that it is not part of the word of God, is only the word of Paul and the Bible is a book full of errors.¬†

In contrast, the early church obeyed the Scriptures on this issue. We can read Clement of Alexandria, a church father of the 2nd and 3rd centuries.

> Men play the part of women, and women that of men, contrary to nature; women are at once wives and husbands: no passage is closed against libidinousness; and their promiscuous lechery is a public institution, and luxury is domesticated. O miserable spectacle! Horrible conduct!
> 
> The Paedagogus (Clement of Alexandria). Chapter 3. Against Men Who Embellish Themselves ([‚Üí](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02093.htm){target=blank})

But contemporary progressive churches say that Clemente has a dystopian vision of reality, because if there is evidence contrary to their presuppositions, that cannot be valid. In contrast, the early church was persecuted, imprisoned and martyred for the alteration of sexual and economic behavior, due to fidelity to the Christian doctrine.

In closing, with all this evidence I am truly convinced that this is the position that Scripture<sup>[^8aad0966-ea10-4b26-af85-6f3eca27662f]</sup>, ancient Christianity, and everything that God and the church have been clearly affirming until now. Therefore, I cannot continue to be a partner of the local congregation because I do not believe in the new position<sup>[^90e3cbfb-e1ab-4eac-bb1d-63d96238335a]</sup> regarding LGBT doctrine. I would have to please<sup>[^93223dda-df4b-41ab-90fa-444804fe676d]</sup> the current culture to claim that, but in my mind I know that is false, so it would make no sense to lie to myself, reject rationality and scriptural teachings.

The first epistle too seems directed, not merely to the several congregations in the city of Corinth, but to other congregations also, "in every place," presumably every place in Greece. At least two verses in the first three chapters, if they do not require this inference, make better sense if so understood. The reference to Greeks in general and not just Corinthians in 1:22, and as well the wherever and whenever of 3:3-4, give some small support to the assumption of a wider public. The first of these two references is the better for this purpose because at first sight it seems strange that Paul has so much to say about wisdom and knowledge to the Corinthians. Corinth was not Oxford; it was Liverpool. Hence when he says in 1:22 that the Greeks seek after wisdom, he may have had Athens in mind. The Corinthians mostly sought after money and pleasure".

For example, the Old Testament says that a man can have many women, the NT instead of opening it up to polyandra, reduced it to just one man and one woman. This makes the law stricter, so opening marriage to people of the same sex is contrary to the spirit of the law. We can see the same stricternes in the Sermon of the Mount, for example: adultery.
